dedupefs is a filesystem for reading Android dedupe backup. This format is used by xrecovery (See https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_bootable_recovery/tree/cm-10.2/dedupe). The backup consists of two parts: some *.dup files and a directory full of files with hexdigit names.

Usage:

Have fuse and gdbm development files installed and run make to have the dedupefs binary compiled.

Before mounting, you need convert a flat *.dup file to a GNUdbm database. You need Python 3 to run the script:

  ./dupconvert /path/to/system.ext4.dup system.db

The you can mount it somewhere:

  ./dedupefs system.db /path/to/blobs/directory your_mount_point

The filesystem is read-only.
